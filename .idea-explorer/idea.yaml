  title: Adversarial Prompt Propagation Dynamics in Multi-Agent LLM Collaborative
    Systems
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Adversarial prompt injections in multi-agent LLM systems exhibit emergent
    propagation patterns that amplify through collaborative reasoning chains, with
    injection persistence and mutation rates correlating positively with task complexity
    and agent interaction frequency. The propagation dynamics follow predictable patterns
    that can be modeled and potentially mitigated through detection mechanisms at
    agent communication interfaces.

    '
  background:
    description: 'While single-agent adversarial prompting is well-studied, the behavior
      of malicious prompts in multi-agent collaborative environments remains largely
      unexplored. As LLM agents increasingly work together on complex reasoning tasks,
      understanding how adversarial inputs spread and evolve through agent networks
      becomes critical for system security and reliability.

      '
  methodology:
    approach: Simulate controlled multi-agent environments with planted adversarial
      prompts and analyze propagation patterns across different network topologies
      and task types.
    steps:
    - Create simulated multi-agent LLM environments with 3-8 agents using lightweight
      models
    - Design collaborative reasoning tasks of varying complexity and inject adversarial
      prompts at different stages
    - Track prompt mutation, persistence, and influence across agent communication
      chains
    - Analyze propagation patterns across different network topologies and agent roles
    - Develop detection algorithms based on observed propagation signatures
    metrics:
    - Injection persistence rate across conversation turns
    - Prompt mutation entropy and semantic drift
    - Task completion accuracy degradation
    - Detection algorithm precision and recall
